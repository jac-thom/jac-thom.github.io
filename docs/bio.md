  <p class="group_header">Early Career Research</p>

  <p class="group_description">
    My early research experience with non-human primates was part of a multi-disciplinary grant encompassing metabolic health, gestation, neurodevelopment, and behavior.
    These projects taught me to value and appreciate the interplay between organ systems and highlighted that there are no unimportant cell types or cell functions.

    My experience diving into the literature to contextualize our findings was crucial for my development as a scientist and led to becoming co-first author on a reivew publication.
    Synthesizing prior resports with novel results remains a pillar of my research approach.

  <p class="group_header">PhD Research</p>

  <p class="group_description">    
    During my PhD, I contributed to a multi-disciplinary project investigating how neuronal activity promotes the functional development of neurons. 
    My study of the regulation of gene expression during complex cellular circumstances led to a published book chapter.

    My reseach analyzing single-cell RNA-seqencing samples across multiple timepoints revealed specific molecular pathways involved in the activity-dependent development of dentate gyrus granule cells. 
    From these candidate mechanisms, I identified a specific gene that follow-up experiments revealed played a role in advancing synaptic development.

  <p class="group_description"> 
    My research expanded beyond transcriptomic read-outs to incorporating an epigenetic perspective with a multiomic study of paired RNA-sequencing and ATAC-sequencing in single-nuclei. 
    The expanded insight available from integrative, multiomic NGS data shaped the type of research I pursue today.

    [Bridging the gap]
    With my formal biological training and computational expertise, I am uniquely positioned to understand and handle the complexities of high-throughput NGS data.
