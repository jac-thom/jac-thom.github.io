  <p class="group_header">Early Career Research</p>
  <p class="group_description">
    My early research experience with non-human primates was part of a multi-disciplinary grant encompassing metabolic health, gestation, neurodevelopment, and behavior.
    These projects taught me to value and appreciate the interplay between organ systems and highlighted that there are no unimportant cell types or cell functions.

  <p class="group_description">
    My experience diving into the literature to contextualize our findings was crucial for my development as a scientist and led to becoming co-first author on a reivew publication.
    Synthesizing prior resports with novel results remains a pillar of my research approach.

  <p class="group_header">PhD Research</p>
  <p class="group_description">
    My PhD training focused on activity-dependent transcriptional regulation in neurons (CITE BOOK CHAPTER). 
    This specialization in the complex control of transcription is invaluable as someone who analyzes the readouts of NGS and interprets the potential in vivo impacts of gene expression changes.

    <li><span style="position: relative; left: 5px;">
      In my current project we are incorporating genetic risk with our investigation of transcriptomic changes in persons with mood disorders.

  <p class="group_description">
    [Bridging the gap]
    With my formal biological training and computational expertise, I am uniquely positioned to understand and handle the complexities of high-throughput NGS data.
  </p>
  <ul class="group_list">
    <li><span style="position: relative; left: 5px;">
      Computation: each dataset is unique (BatchSVG)
    </span></li>
    <li><span style="position: relative; left: 5px;">
      My work with different NGS modalities and tissue preparations has given me a large toolbox with which to navigate the unique considerations each individual dataset requires.
    </span></li>
    <li><span style="position: relative; left: 5px;">
      I have a unique understanding of the various sources of noise in high-throughput NGS data (technical, experimental, circumstantial) and excel at isolating and interpreting strong biological signals from these datasets.
