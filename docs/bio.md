  <p class="group_header">Systems perspective</p>
  <p class="group_description">
    My investigations have focused on central nervous system outcomes with a systems biology perspective.
  </p>
  <ul class="group_list">
    <li>
      My early research experience with non-human primates cemented/ established the importance of a systems biology approach. [one statement about the research goal/ project description (gestational metabolic, immune, neuro, behavioral), cite first authorships]. My experience in this position is how I found out I wanted to ask more mechanistic questions concerning molecular and cellular biology.
    </li>
    <li>
      Whole-genome or whole-transcriptome NGS methods are great because they prevent blinders and allow for data-driven conclusions.
    </li>
    <li>
      In my on-going postdoctoral research project, spatial 3’ RNA-sequencing has highlighted the importance of the neurovascular unit and glial function in persons with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder (unpublished, submission date March 2026 with PsychENCODE V2).

<h1> Central dogma </h1>
My PhD training focused on activity-dependent transcriptional regulation in neurons (CITE BOOK CHAPTER). This specialization in the complex control of transcription is invaluable as someone who analyzes the readouts of NGS and interprets the potential in vivo impacts of gene expression changes. <br><br>

- In my current project we are incorporating genetic risk with our investigation of transcriptomic changes in persons with mood disorders.
- ATACseq and epigenomic factors are important
- Mention TF and gene regulatory networks
- Mention interest in splicing and lncRNA

<h1> Bridging the gap </h1>
With my formal biological training and computational expertise, I am uniquely positioned to understand and handle the complexities of high-throughput NGS data. <br><br>

- Computation: each dataset is unique (BatchSVG)
  - My work with different NGS modalities and tissue preparations has given me a large toolbox with which to navigate the unique considerations each individual dataset requires.
  - I have a unique understanding of the various sources of noise in high-throughput NGS data (technical, experimental, circumstantial) and excel at isolating and interpreting strong biological signals from these datasets.
- Biology: Beyond gene sets, importance of literature
  - Targeting of RASGRP1 (look at what I talked about for my OneNeuro presentation)
- Translational and cross-species integration: My research experience with mouse and non-human primate models and postmortem human tissue
