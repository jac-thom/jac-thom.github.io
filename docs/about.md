<p style="font-size:120%">
Science depends on values, both quantitative and personal. Here are some of my values and what they mean to me.
</p>

<p>
<b>Intrinsic motivation:</b>
I am driven by curiosity, problem-solving, and the desire to make a difference. 
My interests are not limited to a singular research question or model system, and I enjoy conducting all types of translational research.
</p>
<p>
<b>Integrity:</b>
I value the responsibility to conduct clear, reproducible science.
As a data analyst this especially involves the accurate and appropriate identification of sources of bias and limitations.
</p>
<p>
<b>Collaboration:</b>
I favor a collaborative environment and have long recognized that I would like to work as part of a team rather than pursue a career as an independent researcher. 
I am looking for an inter-disciplinary community of peers and mentors with similar values.
</p>
<p>
<b>Communication:</b>
I value excellence in science communication in all forms verbal, written, and visual.
Data visualization is one of my passions as it is a constant challenge to create a clear, truthful, and concise representation of scientific results.
