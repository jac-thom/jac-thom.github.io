<p style="font-size:120%">
Science depends upon values, both quantitative and personal. Here are some of my values and what they mean to me.
</p>

<p>
<b>Intrinsic motivation:</b>
I am driven by curiosity, problem-solving, and the desire to make a difference. Not driven by a singular research question or model system.
</p>
<p>
<b>Integrity:</b>
Accurate and appropriate identification of sources of bias and limitations. Clear and not misleading representation of data.
</p>
<p>
<b>Collaboration:</b>
I favor collaborative environment rather than a position as a financially independent researcher. 
I am looking for an inter-disciplinary community of peers and mentors with similar values.
</p>
<p>
<b>Communication:</b>
I value excellence in science communication: verbal, written, and visual/ graphic.
