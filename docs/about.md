Science depends upon values, both quantitative and personal. Here are some of my values and what they mean to me: <br><br>

- Intrinsic motivation:
  - I am driven by curiosity, problem-solving, and the desire to make a difference
  - Not driven by a singular research question or model system
- Integrity
  - Accurate and appropriate identification of sources of bias and limitations
  - Clear and not misleading representation of data
- Collaboration
  - I favor collaborative environment rather than a position as a financially independent researcher
  - I am looking for an inter-disciplinary community of peers and mentors with similar values
  - Giving a leg-up, opposite of gate-keeping (R course)
- Communication
  - Values excellence in science communication: verbal, written, and visual/ graphic
